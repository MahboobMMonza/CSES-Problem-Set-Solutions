# CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the CSES Problem Set, implemented using C++ 11. The CSES
Problem Set is a comprehensive collection of competitive programming practice problems.

## Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into folders based on the official problem categories found on the CSES website, and are
named approximately the same way as the original problems on the site.

## Solution Approach

Each source file generally includes a comment explaining the intuition behind the solution. These notes are intended to
clarify the logic, strategy, and algorithmic techniques used to arrive at the final implementation.

I usually develop and reuse a template of useful macros/structs/classes, which can vary between files.
## Technical Specifications

* **Language**: C++ 11
* **Target Compiler**: gcc
* **Target System**: Linux / MinGW

**Note:** These solutions are provided for educational and demonstrative purposes. It is recommended to attempt the 
problems independently before consulting these implementations.
